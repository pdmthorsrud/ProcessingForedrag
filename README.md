# ProcessingForedrag
Files used for processing class 7th of september

A lot of these .pde files are taken directly from Daniel Shiffman's github, which is all accompanying code for his awesome youtube videos.
The code is VERY slightly modified, to suit the needs of sutdents attending my (Per Daniel) processing class the 7th of september.
In other words, a lot of the code on here is credited Daniel Shiffman, and NOT me. Please pay the man a visit, and give him some love.
He's awesome!!
